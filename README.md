    - Mark tasks as complete with a checkbox  
    - Delete tasks with a dedicated button  
    - Track overall progress with a progress bar  
    - Play Frutiger Aero / soft-themed background music  
    - Pause and skip between songs  
    - Change backgrounds with a dedicated **BACKGROUND** button
